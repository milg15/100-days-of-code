# Main Commitment

**Start Date**: June 19, 2020. 


# 100 days of code - Log
## Day 1: July 19 (Sunday)
**Today's Progress**: I build a markdown editor for the free code camp full stack certificated. I build it with html, css and js (React). I also build a small Figma design before doing it on the css.

**Thoughts**:  I really enjoyed testing a Figma before committing to a design it was really nice having an idea of what I want the site to look like before doing the code. It's  new habit I might pick up.  This project wasn't a challenge to be honest it was pretty easy to do overall but I liked working on the design.

## Day 2: July 19 (Monday)
**Today's Progress**:  Continuing with FCC I finished today with the Drum Machine challenge of the certificated but I'm not happy with the design it already has all the functionalities but in the coming weeks I might work on the css. So I'll say i just did HTML and JS (React).

**Thoughts**: I'm a bit tired. I worked today coding and the got straight to this. I'll try to take a break at least on weekdays and maybe light exercises in between my back is in a bit of pain.

## Day 3: July 20 (Tuesday)
**Today's Progress**:  I started to build the calculator only created the basic components in react didn't add any styles yet.

**Thoughts**: This day I actually only coded one hour XD. That's why I didn't get a lot done. I've been coding more than an hour but I'll try to stay motivated even if it's just one hour.

## Day 4: July 21 (Wednesday)
**Today's Progress**:  So I cheated today. I didn't do any great ammount of coding today outside the one I do at work but I created a post for my tech and coding related account on instagram about PHP and that took me like two hours ðŸ˜… so I'll say I did something coding related.

**Thoughts**: I played videogames and created this post soo... I need to figure out how to keep doing what I lke without stopping this project. We are just at the beginning cutie pie.

## Day 5: July 22 (Thursday)
**Today's Progress**:  So today I continued with the calculator and I added the funtionalities. It can read a string of numbers and captures the simbols to operate so I only have to do the operations and show the results. 

**Thoughts**: Css is a tad annoying xd I was excited at first but right now I just want it to work. I'm not sure if I'll add any special style or just something basic. I'm thinking to have a week were I only do css and ass style to all the project I did xd.

## Day 6: August 4 (Tuesday)
**Today's Progress**:  I worked with AWS Lambda to work a fun thing <3 (Build a Serverless Web Application)[https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/]. 

**Thoughts**: I had to delete everything because of cost but I had tons of fun learning about this. I want to keep learning more about cloud computing and the way AWS makes this easier is quite surprising.
