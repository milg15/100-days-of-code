# Main Commitment

**Start Date**: June 19, 2020. 


# 100 days of code - Log
## Day 1: July 19 (Sunday)
**Today's Progress**: I build a markdown editor for the free code camp full stack certificated. I build it with html, css and js (React). I also build a small Figma design before doing it on the css.

**Thoughts**:  I really enjoyed testing a Figma before committing to a design it was really nice having an idea of what I want the site to look like before doing the code. It's  new habit I might pick up.  This project wasn't a challenge to be honest it was pretty easy to do overall but I liked working on the design.

## Day 2: July 19 (Monday)
**Today's Progress**:  Continuing with FCC I finished today with the Drum Machine challenge of the certificated but I'm not happy with the design it already has all the functionalities but in the coming weeks I might work on the css. So I'll say i just did HTML and JS (React).

**Thoughts**: I'm a bit tired. I worked today coding and the got straight to this. I'll try to take a break at least on weekdays and maybe light exercises in between my back is in a bit of pain.
